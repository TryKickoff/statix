# Statix changelog

## Version 3.0.0

This release ensures alignment with the Kickoff v5.0.0 updates – see the [Kickoff changelog](https://github.com/TryKickoff/kickoff/blob/master/changelog.md) for full details as there are some major structural and UX changes that improve vastly on v4.

As well as these alignment updates, we have added a better guide to using Markdown with Statix (through Assemble), and have setup the structure for future documentation updates, which will be coming in forthcoming minor releases.


## Version 2.0.0

Updating Statix to use Kickoff V4, and updating NPM package dependencies.

Breaking changes to improve folder structure and to use BrowserSync.


## Version 1.0.0

First major release – setup of Statix on Assemble and Kickoff V3
