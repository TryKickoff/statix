## Standalone Javascript files

Any file that is placed in this directory is copied to `assets/dist/js/standalone`. Examples of files you might place in here are Polyfills (like [matchMedia.js](https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js)) or feature detection libaries (like [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/)) that do not get added to your bundled code.
